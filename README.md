# MP3_Tag

This is a C# program that changes the tags of a mp3 file.

I tried to program it in the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) pattern.
If you are interested in this program, feel free to download the source code and give me hints if something could be done better :).

##Notes
- You can open a context menu when you right click on the files in the data grid.
- You can reorder the data grid files with the keys '+' and '-'.
- You can check the selected datagrid files with the space bar.
